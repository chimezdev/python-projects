#EXERCISE
# Your task is to implement a class called Weeker.
# The class constructor accepts one argument â€“ a string. The string represents 
# the name of the day of the week and the only acceptable values must come from the following set:
# [Mon Tue Wed Thu Fri Sat Sun]
# Invoking the constructor with an argument from outside this set 
# should raise the 'WeekDayError' exception (define the exception yourself)
# objects of the class should be "printable", i.e. they should be able to implicitly convert 
# themselves into strings of the same form as the constructor arguments;
# the class should be equipped with one-parameter methods called add_days(n) and subtract_days(n), 
# with n being an integer number and updating the day of week stored inside the object in the 
# way reflecting the change of date by the indicated number of days, forward or backward.
# all object's properties should be private;

# MY CODE
